# Timeline & File Naming Convention

```{attention}
Ready to make your model outputs accessible to other MIP participants? Please refer to [this page](https://arm-development.github.io/comble-mip/CONTRIBUTING.html) to learn how to upload your model outputs to the repository.
```

Processed model outputs are invited for commit to the GitHub repository under **/comble-mip/output_xxx/YOUR_MODEL_NAME/** where *xxx* can be *les* or *scm*. Within your model's subdirectory, you should place any sensitivity simulations in a directory called **devel**. Once you have preliminary results for the simulation configurations specified in the tables below, you may host them in a directory called **sandbox**. These files can be updated at any time. Once you are happy with your results, and they include the full set of requested variables, you should place them in a directory called **staged**. Any files in the **staged** directory will be considered final by the dates listed in the table below.

We request that you name your simulations as outlined below so that they can be readily compared with other runs using the same test specification. Please add a prefix to each of the file names to distinguish between other models. For example, for the *SCM, liquid-only* specification in Part I, outputs from the ModelE3 SCM model should be named ***ModelE3_FixN_noice***. If your submission is for an LES model, then we ask that you also include a prefix indicating the domain size (units of km) and grid cell spacing (units of m). For example, for the *Small-domain LES, liquid-only* specification in Part I, outputs from the DHARMA LES model should be named ***DHARMA_Lx25_dx100_FixN_noice***.

Our requested prefixes for the domain size and grid cell spacing are as follows for the LES runs:
* Small-domain (Lx=25.6 km, dx=100 m): ***Lx25_dx100***
* Large-domain (Lx=128 km, dx=100 m): ***Lx125_dx100***

If you have additional LES submissions that have different domain sizes and/or grid cell spacings, then we ask that you adjust your prefix information accordingly.

**2D and 3D conventions**: When submitting files containing 2D and 3D snapshot results, please append the below file names using the suffixes ***_2D*** and ***_3D***, respectively.

**Deviations from requested specification**: If you are unable to configure your model according to the requested specification for a particular simulation, then please append to the end of your file by including ***_alt***. We ask that you also include an ***alt*** descriptor as a global attribute to the file to explain how exactly your simulation deviates. Be as descriptive as possible! We will do our best to include deviating simulations with the official MIP results.

**Sensitivity simulations**: We encourage participants to conduct their own sensitivity simulations. If you would like to contribute a sensitivity run, then please append to the end of your file by including ***_sen_x*** where *x* is a number (begin numbering at 1). We ask that you also include a ***sen*** descriptor as a global attribute to the file to explain what sensitivity you've conducted. Again, please be as descriptive as possible!

## Notes
*This simulation will use the default roughness length formulations in each host model. All other simulations will use the fixed roughness lengths as defined on the [Main Model Configuration page](https://arm-development.github.io/comble-mip/main_configuration.html).
<br>
**Given its high computational cost, we suggest that participants refrain from running this setup in case there are any last minute tweaks to the model forcing; for instance, large-scale forcing required to generate realistic roll structures.
<br>
^We plan to first evaluate model outputs before recommending a request date for these additional sensitivity simulations.
