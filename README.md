(Left) MODIS visible satellite image of the 13 March CAO case. Colored lines show backward trajectories beginning at Andenes, Norway (denoted by the blue star) at altitudes of 500, 1000, and 2000 m ASL in cyan, yellow, and blue, respectively. (Right) Time series plots at Andenes, Norway highlighting the convective nature of cellular clouds, characterized by high reflectivity, strong vertical motions, liquid water pockets, and intense turbulence structures.

## Motivation

This website is used to host information about the upcoming Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) large-eddy simulation (LES) / single-column model (SCM) intercomparison efforts. The intercomparison will focus on the 13 March Cold-Air Outbreaks (CAO) event (Fig. 1). We welcome you to explore the website to learn more about the intercomparison framework and workflow.

## Model Inputs

Two files are provided in the DEPHY format, suitable for application to both LES and SCM models: (1) initial and boundary conditions, and (2) surface skin temperature time series.

## Input Conversion Examples

Example scripts to convert the DEPHY standard format to ASCII or other netCDF formats needed to drive specific models.

## Output Conversion Examples

Example scripts to convert specific model results back to the DEPHY standard format prior to submission.

## Visualization Tools

Plotting scripts to compare your results with those submitted from other models. Other submitted results are automatically made available to identified intercomparison participants on a shared ARM-Workbench drive.
