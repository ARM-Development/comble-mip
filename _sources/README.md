## Motivation

This website is used to host information about the upcoming Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) large-eddy simulation (LES) / single-column model (SCM) intercomparison efforts. The intercomparison will focus on the 13 March Cold-Air Outbreaks (CAO) event (Fig. 1). We welcome you to explore the website to learn more about the intercomparison framework and workflow.

## Model Inputs

Two files are provided in the DEPHY format, suitable for application to both LES and SCM models: (1) initial and boundary conditions, and (2) surface skin temperature time series.

## Example Conversion to LES and SCM Inputs
