# COMBLE Model-Observation Intercomparison Project Cookbook

## Motivation

This website is used to host information about the upcoming Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) large-eddy simulation (LES) / single-column model (SCM) intercomparison efforts. The intercomparison will focus on the 13 March Cold-Air Outbreaks (CAO) event (Fig. 1). We welcome you to explore the website to learn more about the intercomparison framework and workflow.

## Model Inputs

Two files are provided in the DEPHY format, suitable for application to both LES and SCM models: (1) initial and boundary conditions, and (2) surface skin temperature time series.

## Examples of Conversion from DEPHY Format to Input Formats Required by Specific LES and SCM Models

Examples scripts to convert the DEPHY input format to ASCII or other netCDF formats needed to drive specific models.

## Examples of Conversion from Specific LES and SCM Model Output Formats back to DEPHY Format

Examples scripts to convert model results back to DEPHY standard format prior to submission.

## Visualization Tools

Plotting scripts to compare your results with those submitted from other models. Other submitted results are automatically made available to identified intercomparison participants on a shared ARM-Workbench drive.
