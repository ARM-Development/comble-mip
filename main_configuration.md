## Notes
*From 0-2h we use a constant ice skin temperature (247.0 K), and from 2–20 h we use time-varying SST from ERA5.<br>
**It is anticipated that prognostic aerosol schemes will account for number losses to collision-coalescence (e.g., rain formation and riming) and potentially others (e.g., dry deposition).
